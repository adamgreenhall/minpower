================

**Minpower** is an :ref:`open source<license>` toolkit for :doc:`students<students>` and :doc:`researchers<researchers>` in power systems.

    `Adam Greenhall <http://adamgreenhall.com>`_ started minpower
    in early 2011 because he needed a good tool for his PhD research
    on stochastic unit commitment and for teaching students at `U. of Washington <http://ee.washington.edu>`_.

        `Sandia National Labs <http://www.pyomo.org/>`_ makes the ``pyomo`` package which is the engine for the optimization that goes on in minpower.

    **Minpower** is openly developed on `github <http://github.com/adamgreenhall/minpower>`_, a code
    hosting site that allows for collaboration by many people, change tracking, and issue hosting.

Development is simple:

    #. Get on github and `fork minpower <http://github.com/adamgreenhall/minpower>`_
    #. Clone Minpower from GitHub: ``git clone http://github.com/<yourname>/minpower``
    #. :abbr:`install it locally (pip's -e flag links you handy-to-find directory to the much more obscure site-packages directory where Python looks for its packages)`: ``pip install -e minpower``

    #. Make it better
    #. Test it out. Minpower uses `Nose <http://nose.readthedocs.org/>`_ and `Travis <travis-ci.org/adamgreenhall/minpower>`_ for testing. To run all of the tests use ``nosetests`` in your local minpower directory.
    #. Make a `pull request <https://github.com/adamgreenhall/minpower/pulls>`_ to get your version in
