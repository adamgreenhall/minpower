For Students
===============

You are probably a grad student in an class like `Power System Economics <http://www.washington.edu/students/crscat/ee.html#ee553>`_ or an undergrad in an upper level course like `Power System Analysis <http://www.washington.edu/students/crscat/ee.html#ee454>`_.

You are probably learning about :doc:`ED <economic-dispatch>`, :doc:`OPF <optimal-power-flow>`, or :doc:`UC <unit-commitment>` and need a tool to solve problems. **Minpower** is the tool for you.
